# VBA_Challenge

## Overview of Project
Purpose of this analysis
In this project, we will be helping Steve â€“ a new graduate in Finance analysis stocks for his parents who are passionate about green energy. Steve is concerned about diversifying his parent funds so he want to analysis a couple of green energy stocks in addition to DQ stock using an excel file containing the stock he will like to analyse. 

The purpose of the analysis is to analyse the stocks for 2017 and 2018 In other to do that, we will be using Visual Basic for Applications (VBA) which is already hosted inside Microsoft Excel.

## Results of the analysis
All the stocks analysed for 2017 have positive returns except the stock for TERP which has a negative return of 7.2 percent. The stock of DQ has the highest return of about 200 percent with total daily volume of approximately 36 million. The high positive value from DQ stock is followed by the stock of SEDG of about 185 percent with a total of about 207 million total daily volume. After TERP, the lease performing stocks are AY and RUN. The script ran in 0.3989258.

The result from 2018 in contrast to 2017 has only two positive returns for ENPH and RUN with approximately 82 percent and 84 percent respectively. ENPH has the highest total daily volume for the year 2018. The execution time of the script is 0.402832.

## Summary of the analysis

##### Advantages
Codes are better organized after refactoring
Refactoring also makes code more maintainable. 
Refactoring improves the logic of the code for future users
Refactored codes make using less memory possible.

###### Disadvantages
You can potentially introduce bugs that your tests won't catch. 
Refactoring makes developers write crappy code in the beginning under the pretext of doing refactoring later
Expensive and time consuming

##### Role of the pros and cons of refactoring the original VBA script
A more efficient program that resulted in faster run times. The performance increase was minimal because the dataset was not too large in this exercise and when weighed against the extra time if took to refactor the original code not of much value. Hours of time were spent to save a fraction of a second in execution time. If the data set were much larger and executed many times only then might the refactoring have been worth the time to do.
